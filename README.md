# Angle_Measurement

Our project aim is to measure the angle for metal formation in laser cutting
machines. Here we do it by using a machine vision application which is
hands-free measurement using image acquisition and image processing
techniques.First we load an image of the metal image in our device,for which we
have to measure angle from our device.
